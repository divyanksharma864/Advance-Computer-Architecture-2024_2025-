Assignment 1: 7-segment display

Two exercises:

A) Perform logic minimisation for segment c: 1) show all prime implicants and write each product they correspond to, 2) show all distinguished 1 cells, 3) show all essential implicants, 4) write the minimal cover. (Either directly digitally done, or hand-written and then well-photographed: both options are fine.)

B) Write the minimised circuit implementing the 7-segment display using logisim.

Create a file of type .pdf for A, a file of type .circ for B, zip them together and turn in a single file. Write your name on both A and B. Thanks.

Advance Computer Architecture 2024-2025

Assignment 1: 7-segment display

Two exercises:

A) Perform logic minimisation for segment c: 1) show all prime implicants and write each product they correspond to, 2) show all distinguished 1 cells, 3) show all essential implicants, 4) write the minimal cover. (Either directly digitally done, or hand-written and then well-photographed: both options are fine.)

B) Write the minimised circuit implementing the 7-segment display using logisim.

Create a file of type .pdf for A, a file of type .circ for B, zip them together and turn in a single file. Write your name on both A and B. Thanks.

Assignment 2: Scheduling Exercise and Sequential Circuits

Two exercises:

A) Perform scheduling for architectures number 2, 3 and 4 of the Scheduling Exercise. Show the exact schedule, and the exact forwarding paths used at any point in time, and compute the resulting CPI. You can use any tool you want to show the computed schedule (written by hand and then scanned is also a possibility) as long as you turn it into a single pdf file.

B) Generate a Latch, a D Latch and a falling edge D Flip Flop using logisim (use nor/and/not gates; do not use the pre-made library elements). Create a single .circ file containing all three components.

Create a single file of type .pdf for A, a single file of type .circ for B, zip them together and turn in a single file. Write your name on both A and B. Thanks.

Assignment 3: With reference to the latest set of Branch Prediction slides:

Two exercises:

A) Solve the exercise on slide 24, for Cases 1 and 2. 

B) Correlating Branch Predictors: solve the exercises on slides 46, 50, 51.

Generate a single pdf containing all your answers, and turn it in.
